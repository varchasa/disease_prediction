<h2>About : </h2>
<p>A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection from microbes. These are organisms that are too small to be seen without a microscope. Most UTIs are caused by bacteria, but some are caused by fungi and in rare cases by viruses. UTIs are among the most common infections in humans.</p>

<h2>Preacautions:</h2>
<p>
   <ul>
   <li>After using toilet, wipe it from front to back. Clean the area around the anus gently. Donâ€™t use same tissue again and again.
   <li>Take a shower bath and avoid sitting in a tub, which may allow the bacteria to reach the opening area of bladder.
   <li>Avoiding long gap between urinating is extremely important. Try to make your bladder empty in every four hours.
   <li>Avoid tight fitting undergarments made up of non breathing materials. Such fabrics cause moisture and leads to maceration of the skin.
   <li>Drink lots of water, you may start with extra one glass of water after every meal. If the color of urine is dark yellow, it means that there is a very less water intake. So to there is a need to increase the fluid intake.
</li>
</ul>
